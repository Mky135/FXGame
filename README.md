# FXGame
Making a who knows what, but at least it's javaFX

# What is going on?
Right now I'm working with a bunch of movable circles in order to get a better understanding of how to use javaFX

# What I've done so far
* Move more then one cirle at a time with arrow keys
* Move diagonially 
* Move with mouse click
* Dynamic lighting (Mouse becomes the source of light)
* Can stop certain circles from moving using the num keys
* Uses a file system in order to modify and save settings so they can be used next time "game" is loaded 

# What I plan on doing
* Clean up messy code
* Make windows look cleaner using css
* Make it more clear which circle is which
* Make it so certain circles can't be passed by (Clipping!!)
